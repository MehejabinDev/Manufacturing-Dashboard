# Manufacturing-Dashboard📊
Developed a Manufacturing Dashboard using power BI to monitor and analyze production performance effectively. The dashboard includes key KPIs such as Processed Quantity, Rejection Quantity, Manufactured Quantity, and Wastage Quantity. Interactive charts and visualizations were created to track:
Production overview
Comparisons across periods or units
Trends in production and rejection
Employee-wise rejection analysis
Machine-wise rejection analysis
Department-wise manufactured vs rejected quantities
The dashboard allows quick insights into production efficiency, wastage control, and process optimization using calculated fields, measures, and interactive charts.
